# Feeding-the-Five-Thousand
public school project  

To whoever's looking at this repository: hello!  
This is a small project I made for a school project  
I've tested it on my computer, but if it doesn't work for you just let me know :)  

Some FAQ:  
Q: Where's the pause button?  
A: If you're dedicated enough to get a high score you won't need to pause (I forgot to add one)  

Q: What's the secret button?  
A: You'll have to check and find out :P  


Have fun!
